        <div class="love-letter">
            <p>Hey Zane, 
                <span class="heart-emoji">‚ô•</span> you probably already know where this is going. You‚Äôve probably been skeptical or known for a while but I just want to be honest and say that I have feelings for you. I don‚Äôt know what it is about you? We don‚Äôt have any similar interests but you somehow find a way to get invested in my interests . You know how to make me smile and laugh when my days are rough. You always check up on me at the right time when I need you. You call yourself a ‚Äúpeople pleaser‚Äù but all I see is a beautiful kind soul who wants to be the best person they can be. I honestly can‚Äôt describe how perfect and beautiful you are as a person, emotionally and physically. You tell yourself you‚Äôre not pretty enough or not good enough but I like to say otherwise. You‚Äôre really are perfect and good enough. I honestly can‚Äôt believe that dudes just don‚Äôt see that in you. You‚Äôre always lusted over and people never see the kind of person you really are. You‚Äôre so sweet, loving, and caring for others and that‚Äôs what I love about you. You‚Äôre one of my biggest reasons why I wake up feeling blessed because I have an amazing person like you in my life. You‚Äôre one of my biggest reasons of having something to live for. I know I may sound crazy because we never hang out in person but every time we talk, I‚Äôm happy I‚Äôm with my favorite person, even though we‚Äôre not physically together. But from the amount of time we‚Äôve spent together on the phone, the conversations we‚Äôve had, the stories of our lives, I like to believe I know enough that you‚Äôre someone I want to be with and a lot of people‚Äôs ideal girlfriend. Even though we don‚Äôt have a lot in common, like you don‚Äôt really like the nerdy things I like, I can look past those because I love you for who you are. That‚Äôs what love is about right? Interests towards someone despite them having things that are ‚Äúimperfections‚Äù. Having interests for someone who are themselves. Besides your loving personality, I also want to speak on how beautiful you are. You say that you‚Äôre ugly and that your skin color is a contributing factor to it. I want to say that you‚Äôre not ugly. You are a literal goddess. And for your skin color, I know that you‚Äôve talked about being bullied for it and I‚Äôm really sorry to hear that. Ive said this a bunch of times but your skin color has nothing to do with you being ‚Äúugly‚Äù. In fact, I believe that it‚Äôs a contributing factor to what makes you so beautiful and anybody that thinks otherwise is just ignorant and racist. If I have to be honest, I go through your ig highlights to admire how beautiful you are and I‚Äôm being serious lmao. You're so good at doing makeup and I love it when you do it. You don‚Äôt have a style, but every style you‚Äôve tried, you've always looked so good in it. So, now it all comes down to one question‚Ä¶ May I be your boyfriend, Zane? Maybe we should go on a few dates first? if we can even find the time to go on a date. If not, it‚Äôs ok.  I hope this didn‚Äôt ruin our friendship as I would like to remain good friends if you say no. I don‚Äôt ever want to lose an amazing person like you. I honestly don‚Äôt know how I would be doing right now mentally, if we never became friends. Again, I‚Äôm so glad to have you in my life and call you a friend. I‚Äôm glad to have someone I can talk to, someone who has my back and can brighten my day. One thing I want to point out, please do not date me out of pity. Just be honest with yourself and I. We can both agree that I‚Äôm not physically attractive and I know for a fact that I don‚Äôt meet the beauty standards of your ideal man. I also don‚Äôt want you feeling bad that you rejected me. I understand if you do reject me, whether if it has to do with me being not attractive or whatever the case is. One last thing I want to say is that I‚Äôm so proud of you for how strong you are. I know you‚Äôre not doing mentally well. You have suicidal and self destructive thoughts. But somehow, you push through that and carry on. I‚Äôm so glad and proud that you‚Äôre strong enough to do that because I know for a fact that amazing things are going to happen ahead later in your life. You‚Äôre special, and I don‚Äôt want you missing out on the amazing life you‚Äôre going to have down the road. I don't ever want a loved one who takes their life when they have great potential lying ahead of them. Stay strong Zane! I love you.‚ù§Ô∏è Sleep well and have a goodnight.</p>
